Documentation
-------------
1. run command "yarn install"
2. to run application "yarn serve"
3. to run unit test "yarn test:unit"


Notes
------
1. I use typescript for this project
2. I use element-ui as your suggestion and vue-cli
3. For draggable card, I use vuedraggable
4. For test I use jest (built in from vuejs)
5. For runner I use babel (first I thought use webpack, but I think it's too overkill in this mini project)
6. For linting, I use tslint from AirBnb

Project Structure
-----------------
1. I split into 4 files in every part of component
   a. .component.html (it is to separate our html design from .vue file)
   b. .component.scss (it is to separate our css from .vue file)
   c. .component.spec.ts (for unit test)
   d. .component.vue (for vue code)
   - the reason I split that into 4 files, because it would be bloated in 1 file (.vue)
2. I create folder constants, so every constants which I need will be there
3. And also folder models
4. To reduce business login inside component, it would be better if use action, reducer. But I think it would be overkill in this mini project. And business logic for this miniproject is not big enough


Thank you.
